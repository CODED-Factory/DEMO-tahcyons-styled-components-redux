# Contributing to this project

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

You can find a list of pending features in the [project board]().

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to contribute to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Clone the repo and create your branch from `staging`.
   **DO NOT** branch from `master`.
2. Your branch name should follow the format `<feature-number>-<meaningful-feature-name>`.
3. Open a pull request as soon as possible.
4. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
5. If you've added or changed APIs, reference the matching pull request from the backend repo.
6. Ensure the test suite passes.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Make sure you have `prettier` installed and configured correctly
